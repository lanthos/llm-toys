This repo is a place for me to try out different ideas for using LLMs.

To get started you'll need to install:

[ollama](https://ollama.com/)

I suggest getting the llmama 3.1 8B model to start with.

Once it's downloaded start it up with:

```bash
ollama run llama3.1
```

Then you can run the script from the cli after installing stuff from requirements into your virtualenv.
